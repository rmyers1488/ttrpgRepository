            This small pepperbox pistol follows the same principle as the
            coat pistol. It is both smaller and less powerful than a standard
            size pepperbox pistol. It's compact size makes it easier to conceal
            on your body, a +2 bonus to Sleight of Hand.
            <br /> A coat pepperbox has only four barrels instead of the six of
            a regular sized pepperbox. A coat pepper box's barrels are small
            enough and back far enough to be rotated using your thumb allowing

            a very short bayonet, and brass knuckles all folded in for ease of carry.

            an action to remove the knuckles and turn it around to use either the bayonet or
            the revolver.
            when the revolver, bayonet and brass knuckels are folded in it has a +4 bonus
            to conealing it on your person.

            -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls. The bayonet deals 1d3 piercing damage with a

            fact that it does not use metal cartridges means that ammunition can be made
