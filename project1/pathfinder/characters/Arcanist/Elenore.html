            <h1>Elenore, the Enchanting Courtesian</h1>
            <p>
                Most pretty young girls grow up in loving households and merry decent young men.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elenore is not most pretty young girls and certainly did not grow up in a loving 
                household. At a young age she was taken from her home and forced into slavery. 
                Now being a half-elf in a culture that feared elves meant that she was subjected 
                to more cruelty then her peers. Once she entered puberty it was almost certain 
                that she would be raped.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully for her she was purchased from her previous owner by the owner of a
                certain brothel. Elenore believed that nothing would change but, everything did. 
                Her new master had different plans in mind for her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her new master, one Tilvia Ashertil, was no ordinary woman. As a multi century old
                vampiress, possibly millenia old vampiress, she rules a vast business empire and 
                steers politics as a hobby. And she had a son. A young swordsman who was named Ahmeen
                but calls himself Joseph.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tilvia’s greatest desire is grandchildren but Joseph is determined to not give her 
                any. That is where Elenore comes in. Tilvia has raised that girl into a woman with
                charm, grace, and strength. She has raised her with the sole purpose of Elenore 
                becoming the mother of her grandchildren.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an education consisting of a noblewoman’s skills, the cortesian arts, magic, 
                and the more subtle arts of assassination. This training has turned a meek slave 
                fearful of the quip into a confident young woman capable of holding her own in any
                setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joining Joseph as an adventurer she has found that she rather enjoys trasping about
                and dealing with bandits and collecting rewards for dealing with monsters. Now if
                she could only convince him about that baby.
            </p>
