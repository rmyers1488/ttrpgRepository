                After what was known as the third world war it took the world
                years to recover. The final act of the madness was the detonation
                of nuclear weapons in several large cities through the world. In
                several countries rebellions, violent protests, and natural disasters
                caused great damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, 27 years after the end of the 3rd World War, the world has
                stabilized and some areas are stronger then before.
                Basic international law includes advanced AI being illegal. In
                most countries genetic modification, beyond what would be medically
                necessary, ranges from frowned upon to outright illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here in the USA cop shootings of unarmed civilians gave rise the
                adaption of non-lethal weapons. Firearms that only fire stun rounds.
                The round transfers the energy to the target.

            <p>
                A certain level, medical for the most part, of genetic engineering
                is legal. However there is a geneticist who went rouge and actually
                started a criminal organization to fund his research. The members
                of his group are often altered, often with anamalistic traits that
                range from dog ears or short coat of fur to the more extensive,
                muzzles or tails or something more full body.

                It is taking place in the city of Portland.

                The third World War has rendered most of Californa, Nevada & Utah
                uninhabited with the western half of Utah third of Ariozna are
                likewise damaged. Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina were hit
                hard in WW III.
